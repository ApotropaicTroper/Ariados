Learning Python via creating a web spider designed to crawl Bulbapedia, gathering data on all (721) pok√©mon and (621) moves.
Mons and Moves stored separately, with one .txt per Mon/Move.
- Mon files include:  
  Species  
  Form, if alternate forms (such as megas) exist  
  Type(s)  
  Ability(s)  
  Base stats  
  Weight  
- Move files include:  
  Name  
  Type  
  Category  
  Power  
  Accuracy  
  PP  
  What mons can learn the move outside of events

To do: rework 'Mon' file to use new .txt file formatting
(How to search for filenames? "import os" is the only way I've found)
